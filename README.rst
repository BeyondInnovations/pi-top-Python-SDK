A simple interface to pi-top Maker Architecture components with pi-top [4].

About
=====

Component interfaces are provided to allow a frictionless way to get started
with physical computing.

With very little code, you can quickly get going connecting your components
together.

The library includes interfaces to many simple everyday components, as well as
some more complex things like sensors, analogue-to-digital converters, full
colour LEDs, robotics kits and more. See the `Recipes`_ chapter of the
documentation for ideas on how to get started.

============

The pi-top Maker Architecture API is installed by default in the pi-topOS desktop image, available from
`pi-top.com`_. To install on Raspbian Lite or other operating systems,
including for PCs using remote GPIO, see the `Installing`_ chapter.
